## Favorite CPSC 120L Lab's
* Lab 1

  This lab was memorable because of its chaos. It was our very first class, and we couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work, so we had to change classrooms multiple times. Despite the challenges, including my partner and I not submitting it correctly, it still ended up being one of my favorite labs we've done.

* Lab 03

  This lab was fun because I made a new friend through it. However, it was also challenging since it was the first lab I had to finish outside of class time. Figuring out the syntax errors and including the formulas was tough, but overall, I had a great time working through it. The process of overcoming these challenges made the experience rewarding and enjoyable.

* Lab 08 

   This lab was fun because it was the first time I got to partner up with one of my only friends in the class. It was also one of the first times we used if statements, and I found it super interesting to figure them out. The combination of working with a friend and learning something new made this lab one of the most memorable experiences for me.
