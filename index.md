## Favorite CPSC 120L Lab's
* Lab 1
  
  This lab was memorable because of its chaos. It was our very first class, and we couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work, so we had to change classrooms multiple times. Despite the challenges, including my partner and I not submitting it correctly, it still ended up being one of my favorite labs we've done. Navigating through technical difficulties and adhering to the Google C++ coding style taught me to adapt quickly and appreciate the importance of coding standards and documentation. Writing meaningful git log comments improved my ability to communicate changes clearly and effectively in a collaborative environment.

* Lab 03

  This lab was fun because I made a new friend through it. However, it was also challenging since it was the first lab I had to finish outside of class time. Figuring out the syntax errors and including the formulas was tough, but overall, I had a great time working through it. Adhering to the Google C++ coding style and ensuring the AUTHORS.md file was correctly formatted taught me the importance of organization and attention to detail. Writing a function to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Mifflin St Jeor equation introduced me to practical applications of mathematical equations in programming. Additionally, using various makefile commands and debugging techniques enhanced my coding and problem-solving skills

* Lab 08 

   This lab was fun because it was the first time I got to partner up with one of my only friends in the class. It was also one of the first times we used if statements, and I found it super interesting to figure them out. The combination of working with a friend and learning something new made this lab one of the most memorable experiences for me. Writing a function to compute the average mean, excluding the minimum and maximum values, taught me how to implement algorithms that ensure fairness and accuracy. Following the debug procedures for compile, runtime, and logic errors improved my problem-solving and debugging skills, while using various shell commands enhanced my proficiency with the command line and
